# Wifi-robot-localization

This project implements a simulation-based approach for indoor robot localization using Wi-Fi signals. By leveraging RSSI (Received Signal Strength Indicator) and Angle of Arrival (AoA) data from multiple Wi-Fi routers, the system estimates the robot's position in a 3D environment. The project includes environment setup, signal modeling, localization algorithms (including 2D-MUSIC for AoA estimation), and visualization tools, all developed using MATLAB.
